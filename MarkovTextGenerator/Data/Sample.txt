Turning now to local news, we're getting reports of surges and power outages all across the county.
Last night, hundreds of homes in East Hawkins were affected, leaving many residents in the dark.
The cause of the outage is still unknown.
We reached out to Roane County Water and Electric, and a spokesperson says that they are confident power will be restored to all remaining homes within the next several hours.
Mmm.
In other news, you might wanna stay home tonight or at least pack an umbrella.

- And was someone else there? - I - Mom, who was there? Who was it? - It was him.
I know it was his breathing.
I know it was his breathing.
Will! - Will! - Byers! I've got your X-Men 134! Guys, I really think we should turn back.
Seriously, Dustin? You wanna be a baby, then go home already! I'm just being realistic, Lucas! No, you're just being a big sissy! Did you ever think Will went missing because he ran into something bad? And we're going to the exact same spot where he was last seen? - And we have no weapons or anything? - Dustin, shut up.
I'm just saying, does that seem smart to you? Shut up.
Shut up.

- Is that better? - Yes.
- This is mental.
- At least she can talk.
She said "no" and "yes.
" Your three-year-old sister says more.
She tried to get naked.
There's something seriously wrong with her.
- Like, wrong in the head.
- She just went like I bet she escaped from Pennhurst.
- From where? - The nuthouse in Kerley County.
- You got a lot of family there? - Bite me.
Seriously though, think about it.
That would explain her shaved hair and why she's so crazy.
Why she went like She's an escapee is the point.
She's probably a psycho.
- Like Michael Myers.
- Exactly! We should've never brought her here.
So you just wanted to leave her out in that storm? Yes! We went out to find Will, not another problem.
- I think we should tell your mom.
- I second that.
- Who's crazy now? - How is that crazy? 'Cause, we weren't supposed to be out tonight, remember? - So? - So if I tell my mom and she tells your mom and your mom - Oh, man.
- Our houses become Alcatraz.
Exactly.
We'll never find Will.
All right, here's the plan.
She sleeps here tonight.
- You're letting a girl - Just listen! In the morning, she sneaks around my house, goes to the front door and rings my doorbell.
My mom will answer and know exactly what to do.
She'll send her back to Pennhurst or wherever she comes from.
We'll be totally in the clear.
And tomorrow night, we go back out.
And this time, we find Will.
Here you go.
This is my sleeping bag.
You really think she's psycho? Wouldn't want her in my house.
Mental.
Hey, um, I never asked your name.
Is that real? Sorry, I've just never seen a kid with a tattoo before.
What's it mean? Eleven? That's your name? Eleven.
Okay.
Um, well, my name's Mike.

Maybe we can call you "El.
" Short for Eleven.
Um, well, okay.
'Night, El.
'Night, Mike.
All right, Mom.
Breakfast is ready.

God.
Flo says you got a phone call? Oh, yeah.
Storm barbecued this pretty good.
- The storm? - What else? You're saying that that's not weird? No, it's weird.
Can we, like, trace who made the call? Contact the No, it doesn't work like that.
Now, uh, you're sure it was Will? Because Flo said you just heard some breathing.
No.
It was him.
It was Will.
And he was scared.
And then something It was probably just a prank call.
It was somebody trying to scare you.
- Who would do that? - Well, this thing's been on TV.
It brings out all the crazies, you know.
False leads, prank calls, uh No, Hopper, it was not a prank.
It was him.
- Joyce.
- Come on, how about a little trust here? What, you think I'm I'm making this up? I'm not saying that you're making it up.
All I'm saying is it's an emotional time for you.
And you think I don't know my own son's breathing? Wouldn't you know your own daughter's? - You hear from, uh, Lonnie yet? - No.
It's been long enough.
I'm having him checked out.
Oh, come on! You're wasting your time.
Hey, Hopper.
Hopper.
Let me go.
- I'm sorry? - To Lonnie's.
You know, if Will's there, it means he ran away.
And if he sees the cops, he'll think he's in trouble.
He'll He'll hide.

Mostly Lucas, 'cause he lives so close.
Signal's pretty weak.
Got you breakfast.
So listen, this is gonna sound a little weird, but I just need you to go out there.
Then go to the front door and ring the doorbell.
My mom will answer and you'll tell her that you're lost and that you need help.
But whatever you do, you can't tell her about last night or that you know me.
Understand? Really, it's no big deal.
We'll just pretend to meet each other again.
And my mom, she'll know who to call.
No.
No? No.
No you don't want my mom to get help? You're in trouble, aren't you? Who Who are you in trouble with? Bad.

Less than two miles away.
- And the boy? - Still missing.
It was my son.

Oh, if Mrs.
Wheeler tells my parents - No way.

We got first every year.
Except for last year when we got third.
Mr.
Clarke said it was totally political.

I just I don't feel good.
I woke up and my head, it really hurt bad, and my throat was all scratchy, and I wanted to tell you, but the last time I told you I was sick - you made me go to school anyway, and - Michael.
- Yeah? - I'm not mad at you.
- No? - No, of course not.
All this that's been going on with Will, I can't imagine what it's been like for you.
I just I want you to feel like you can talk to me.
I never want you to feel like you have to hide anything from me.
I'm here for you.
Okay? Is there someone else here? No.
Eleven? Is everything okay? El? - Mike.
- Is everything okay? Are you sure? Promise.
- Will Byers! - Will! Whoa, whoa.
Careful, careful.
I need you alive for the next few days, at least.
Oh, hell, I could survive that.
What? George Burness made the jump.
And he was drunk as a skunk.
He did it on a $10 bet.
George is a liar.
You make that jump from this height, that water turns into cement.
Hits you like a ton of bricks.
Break every damn bone in your body.
Nah.
Chief, you copy? Yeah, Flo, talk to me.
Hey, Chief, we got a call from over at Benny's.
I think you need to get there right away.
Ugh, Jesus! Suicide? Mmm-hmm.
Missing kid, suicide You must feel like a big city cop again, huh, Chief? Well, I mostly dealt with strangers back then.
Benny was my friend.
Hello? Yeah.
- Can I help you? - Yeah, is Lonnie around? - Yeah, he's out back.
What do you want? - To look around.
- Hey, what do you think you're doing? Hey! - I'll be fast.
Hey, Will? Will! Will, you here? Will! Get off! Damn, you've gotten stronger.
Will someone please explain what the hell is going on? Jonathan, Cynthia.
Cynthia, this is Jonathan.
My oldest.
- Come here.
- Get off me, man.
- Are you out of your mind? - Just listen to me.
- You are out of your mind! - She knows about Will.
What do you mean she knows about Will? She pointed at him, at his picture.
She knew he was missing.
I could tell.
- You could tell? - Just think about it.
Do you really think it was a coincidence that we found her on Mirkwood, the same place where Will disappeared? - That is weird.
- And she said bad people are after her.
I think maybe these bad people are the same ones that took Will.
- I think she knows what happened to him.
- Then why doesn't she tell us? Do you know where he is? Do you know where Will is? - Stop it, you're scaring her! - She should be scared! If you know where he is, tell us! This is nuts.
We have to take her to your mom.
No! Eleven said telling any adult would put us in danger.
- What kind of danger? - Her name is Eleven? - El for short.
- Mike, what kind of danger? Danger danger.
No, no, no! We're going back to plan A.
We're telling your mom.
No.
Take a look at this beaut.
Should've seen it when I got it.
Took me a year, but it's almost done.
Really? You want to check up my ass, too? I told you the same thing as I told those cops, he's not here and he never has been.
- Then why didn't you call Mom back? - I don't know, I just I assumed she just forgot where he was.
You know, he was lost or something.
That boy never was very good at taking care of himself.
This isn't some joke, all right? There are search parties, reporters Hopper's not still chief, is he? Tell your mother she's gotta get you out of that hellhole.
Come out here to the city.
People are more real here, you know? And then I could see you more.
- What, you think I don't want to see you? - I know you don't.
See, that's your mother talkin' right there.
She even know you're here? Oh, great.
So one kid goes missing, the other one runs wild? Some real fine parenting right there.
Look, all I'm saying is, maybe I'm not the asshole, all right? In case you forgot what he looks like.
He's kinda cute, hmm? Maybe I'll trade you in for the younger model? Just doesn't make any sense, Chief.
You, uh, notice anything odd about him the last few weeks? No, we're fixin' to go fishing down the Etowah next Sunday.
I mean, he was lookin' forward to it.
I know that.
He got any enemies you might know about? I mean, people who might not want him around? The exes didn't like him much.
That's for sure, but nah.
- When was the last time you saw him? - Yesterday.
Lunch, same as always.
- Just you and the boys? - Yep.
Me and Henry and Well, there was this, uh, this kid.
No kid did this.
Kid? What are you talking about? Yeah.
At lunch, uh, there was this boy that, uh I mean, he was trying to steal food out of Benny's kitchen.
Can you imagine that? This kid what'd he look like? Well, he was about yea high.
You know, tiny like.
I didn't get a good look at him, though.
He was back in the kitchen.
He look like this? Oh, no, that's That's Lonnie's missin' kid.
No.
This was a different kid.
This one had really short hair.
I mean, it was buzzed nearly down to the scalp.
Yeah, well, let's You know, let's forget about the haircut.
I mean, if this kid had a buzz cut could it be Lonnie's kid? Well, I I didn't get a good look at him.
About the right height, though.
I mean, could've been.
Yeah, that's Could've been.
Because I don't want to go by myself.
Barb Barb, it's not rocket science.
You just tell your parents you're gonna stay at my place afterwards.
No, tell them we're studying.
Nancy! Dinner! Coming! Look, I gotta go.
I'll see you in an hour.
Something wrong with the meatloaf? Oh, no, I had two bologna sandwiches for lunch.
I don't know why.
Me, too.
- It's delicious, Mommy.
- Thank you, sweetie.
So, there's this special assembly thing tonight for Will at the school field.
Barb's driving.
Why am I just hearing about this? I thought you knew.
I told you, I don't want you out after dark until Will is found.
I know, I know, but it'd be super weird if I'm not there.
I mean, everyone's going.
Just be back by 10:00.
Why don't you take the boys, too? - No! - Mmm-mmm.
Don't you think you should be there? For Will? Sorry.
Spasm.
Oh It's okay, Holly.
- It's just a loud noise.
- Nice.
Will! Better come out, buddy.
Will, where are ya? Hey, you think Earl really saw Will? I mean, what's he doin' with a shaved head? And stealing food from Benny? Tell you what, when we find him, we'll ask.
Can't ask a corpse questions.
Hold up! You got something? - Hey, what do you got? - Not sure.
Maybe nothing.
I found this.
In there.
No way a kid crawls through there.
I don't know a scared enough one might.
His brother said he was good at hiding.
El? No adults.
Just us and some meatloaf.
Don't worry.
They won't tell anyone about you.
They promise.
Right? We never would've upset you if we knew you had superpowers.
Ow! What Dustin is trying to say is that they were just scared earlier.
That's all.
We just wanted to find our friend.
"Friend"? Yeah, friend.
Will? What is "friend"? Is she serious? Um, a friend Is someone that you'd do anything for.
You lend them your cool stuff, like comic books and trading cards.
And they never break a promise.
- Especially when there's spit.
- Spit? - A spit swear means - you never break your word.
It's a bond.
That's super important, because friends they tell each other things.
Things that parents don't know.
- Barbara, pull over.
- What? Pull over! What are we doing here? His house is three blocks away.
We can't park in the driveway.
Are you serious? Yeah, the neighbors might see.
This is so stupid.
I'm just gonna drop you off.

No, he doesn't.
Nance seriously.
He invited you to his house.
His parents aren't home.
Come on, you are not this stupid.
Tommy H.

Tommy and Carol have been having sex since, like, seventh grade.
It'll probably just be, like, a big orgy.
- Gross.
- I'm serious! All right, well you can be, like, my guardian.
All right? Make sure I don't get drunk and do anything stupid.
Ugh.
Is that a new bra? No.

Army knife also from 'Nam.
Hammer, camouflage bandana and the wrist rocket.
You're gonna take out the Demogorgon with a slingshot? First of all, it's a wrist rocket.

It's made up.
But if there is something out there, I'm gonna shoot it in the eye - and blind it.
- Dustin, what did you get? Well, alrighty.
So, we've got Nutty Bars, Bazooka, Pez, Smarties, Pringles, Nilla Wafers, apple, - banana, and trail mix.

You know, like, Reagan's Star Wars.
I guess we're gonna blow the Ruskies to smithereens.
Hey, can I help you? Uh, yeah.
We're here for a tour.
Oh, we don't give tours.
Okay A quick look around.
You have to get clearance for that.
You can contact, uh Rick Schaeffer at the Department of Energy.
Maybe you seen it on TV.
We got a local kid that's missing.
We have reason to believe he might have snuck in here.
Like I said, you have to speak to Mr.
Schaeffer.
- What's your name? - Patrick.
Patrick, I got a panicked mayor, and I got reporters breathing down my neck and I got a very upset mother.
Now, I know the kid's not in there, but I gotta check off this box.
Patrick, would you do me a favor? Would you speak to your boss and see what you can swing for us? I'd really appreciate it.
I'm talking ten minutes, tops.
was occupying a large part of Lebanon.
Today, Syria has become a home for I have the power! gift that will last forever.
From the Harmony Treasures' collection On the beach and in the sun The real thing is so much fun All the times of your life And the things that you do Coke is right there with you Coke is it! Coke is it! - Joyce - Just ring me up, Donald.
And you think this missing boy may have crawled through there? Well, that was the idea.
Yeah, I just don't see how that'd be possible.
We've got over 100 cameras.
Every square inch covered, plus all my guys.
No one breaks in here.
Certainly not some kid.
Those cameras, you keep the tapes? If you don't mind me asking, what do you guys do in here? You're asking the wrong guy.
- Staying one step ahead of the Russians? - I expect.
Something like that.
- Who's in charge here? - That'd be Dr.
Brenner.
And he builds the space lasers? - Space lasers? - Ignore him.
This is the night of the 6th and 7th we're seeing here? That's correct.
Is that it? Like I said, we would have seen him.
The night of the 7th, we had a search party out for Will.
You remember anything about that night? Mmm, not much to remember.
Called it off.
- 'Cause of the storm.
- Yeah, a lot of rain that night.
You see any rain on that tape? What are you thinking? I don't know.
But they're lying.
That's why science doesn't make any damn sense to me.
No, I swear.
Look at this.
It's totally frostbite.
Oh, thanks, man.
It's a heated pool.
Well, if it's not frostbite, then what is it? Ugh, I don't care what it is, it's disgusting! Get it off the table.
We're eating here.
Ew! Hey, Tommy.
When you left, did you see Barb? - What? - Barbara.
She's not here today.
I seriously have no idea who you're talking about.
Come on, don't be an ass, man.
Did you Did you see her leave last night or not? No, she was gone when we left.
Probably couldn't stand listening to all that moaning.
Oh, Steve! - Oh, Steve! Oh, Steve! - Oh, Steve Oh, Steve! Okay, chill.
Listen I'm sure she's fine.
She's probably just she's probably just, like, skipping or something.
Yeah.
Yeah, probably.
- How about this one? - Too big for the sling.
So, do you think Eleven was born with her powers, like the X-Men, or do you think she acquired them, like like Green Lantern? She's not a superhero.
She's a weirdo.
Why does that matter? The X-Men are weirdos.
If you love her so much, why don't you marry her? What are you talking about? - Mike, seriously? - What? You look at her all, like "Hi, El! El! El! El! I love you so much! - Would you marry me?" - Shut up, Lucas.
Yeah, shut up, Lucas.
What are you losers doing back here? Probably looking for their missing friend.
That's not funny.
It's serious.
He's in danger.
I hate to break it to you, Toothless, but he's not in danger.
He's dead.
That's what my dad says.
He said he was probably killed by some other queer.
Come on.
Just ignore them.
Watch where you're going, Frogface.
- You all right? - Yeah.
Hey.
How about this one? - Yeah.
- Yeah? Yeah, this is it.
Oh, yeah.

" Yep.
I'm sorry.
Uh Maybe we could go out again next week? Newspapers? You guys got newspapers around here? We have the New York Times, the Post, all the big ones.

But she did come home, right? After the vigil? No, she said she was staying with you last night.
Right, yes.
She did, sorry.
I meant, did she come home this morning? I think she left some textbooks and she was gonna go pick them up.
Oh, um, no, I haven't seen her.
Do Do you know what? I just remembered she's at the library.
Nancy, will you please have her call me as soon as you find her? Yeah.
Yeah, I will.
Sorry to bother you.

- I was looking for my brother.
- No.
No, this is called stalking.
Mmm-hmm.
- What's going on? - Here's the starring lady.
What? This creep was spying on us last night.
He was probably gonna save this one for later.
See, you can tell that he knows it was wrong, but Man, that's the thing about perverts It's hardwired into 'em.
You know, they just can't help themselves.
So we'll just have to take away his toy.
- Steve - No, please, not the camera.
No, no, wait, wait Tommy, Tommy.
It's okay.

El! You okay? Hop on.
We only have a few hours.
So, I told Mr.
Mundy "The solution of ten plus Y equals blow me.
" Bull, if you did that, you'd be in detention right now.
Saturday.
I bet Mr.
Mundy's still a virgin.
Oh, he's so a virgin! Maybe you should blow him, Carol.
Help your grades a bit.
Whoa, Nance, where you going? I totally forgot.
I told my mom I would, um I would do something with her.
Well, what do you mean? The game's about to start.
I'm sorry.
What the hell's wrong with her? Maybe she freaked out when you went all psycho on the psycho.
Oh, give me a break.
What'd you expect, dating Miss Perfect? Why did they hurt you? What? Oh, that.
Uh I just fell at recess.
- Mike - Yeah? Friends tell the truth.
I was tripped by this mouth breather, Troy, okay? Mouth breather? Yeah, you know a dumb person.
A knucklehead.
Knucklehead? I don't know why I just didn't tell you.
Everyone at school knows.
I just didn't want you to think I was such a wastoid, you know? - Mike - Yeah? I understand.
Oh.
Okay, cool.
Cool.
Barb? Barb! Barb? Barb? Barb? Oh! Will are you here? Okay, good, good, good, good.

Where where are you? Can you can you tell me where you are? Can you Please, baby.
I need to find you.
Tell me what to do.
Please just Will Hey! You're home early! How was the game? Nancy? What's the matter? It's Barb.
I think something happened.
Something terrible.
I don't know, Chief.
What don't you know? This lady, Terry Ives, sounds like a real nut to me.
Her kid was taken for LSD mind control experiments? She's been discredited.
Claim was thrown out Okay, forget about her.
Take a look at this.
- Dr.
Martin Brenner.
- Who? Brenner.
He runs Hawkins Lab.
Okay.
You don't find that interesting? Not really.
He was involved in some hippie crap back in the day, so what? No, this isn't hippie crap.
This is CIA-sanctioned research.
Doesn't mean he had anything to do with our kid.
Come on.
Look at that.
Hospital gowns.
All of 'em.
Now, that piece of fabric that the teacher found by the pipe.
That sure looked like a hospital gown to me, huh? - Am I wrong? - I don't know, Chief.
Come on, man.
Work with me here.
I'm not saying that there's some grand conspiracy.
I'm just I'm saying maybe something happened.
Maybe Will was in the wrong place at the wrong time and he saw something that he shouldn't have.
- It's a reach.
- It's a start.
Hey, Powell, is the chief with you? Hopper here.
What do you got? Here.
Yeah, this is where Will lives.
Hiding.
No, no, this is where he lives.
He's missing from here.
Understand? - What are we doing here? - She said he's hiding here.
Um no! I swear, if we walked all the way out here for nothing That's exactly what we did.
I told you she didn't know what the hell she was talking about! Why did you bring us here? - Mike, don't waste your time with her.
- What do you want to do then? Call the cops, like we should have done yesterday.
- We are not calling the cops! - Hey, guys? - What other choice do we have? - Guys! Will Okay.
Okay, baby, talk to me.
Talk to me.
Where are you? "R.
" Good, good, good, good.
That's good.
Come on, come on.
"I G H T H E R E" "Right here.
" "Right here"? I don't know what that means.
I need you to tell me what to do.
What should I do? How do I get to you? How do I find you? What should I do? Oh, Jesus.
Oh, God.
Please tell me it's not the kid.
It's not Will.
It can't be.
It's Will.
It's really Will.
Mike "Mike"? "Mike," what? You were supposed to help us find him alive.
You said he was alive! Why did you lie to us? What's wrong with you? What is wrong with you? - Mike - What? Mike, come on.
Don't do this, man.
Mike Mike, where are you going? Mike! Mike! Mom? Mom, what happened? It's okay.
Hey.
Michael? What's wrong? Support us and become VIP member 
This the wall she was talking about, Chief? A trooper found something in the, uh water that's at the quarry.
Our working theory right now is that Will crashed his bike, he made his way over the quarry and, uh accidentally fell in.
The earth must have given way.
Joyce? Joyce? Do you understand what I'm saying? No.
Whoever you found is not my boy.
- It's not Will.
- Joyce.
No, you don't understand.
I talked to him a half hour ago.
He was He was here.
He was He was talking with these.
- Talking? - Uh-huh.
One blink for yes, two for no.
And And, uh And then I made this so he could talk to me.
'Cause he was hiding from that that thing.
The thing that came out of the wall? - The thing that chased you? - Yeah.
- Yeah.
- Mom, come on, please.
- You've gotta stop this.
- No, maybe he's It's after him! - He's in danger.
We have to find him! We - What exactly was this thing? It was some kind of animal, you said? Uh, no, it was It was almost human, but it wasn't.
It It had these long arms and it didn't have a face.
It didn't have a face? - Joyce.
- It didn't have a face Joyce, listen to me.
Listen to me.
After Sarah I saw her, too.
And I heard her.
I didn't know what was real.
And then I figured out that it was in my mind.
And I had to pack all that away.
Otherwise, I was gonna fall down a hole that I couldn't get out of.
No, you're you're talking about grief.
This is different.
- I'm just saying that you - No, I know what you're saying, Hop.
I swear to you, I know what I saw.
And I'm not crazy.
I'm not saying that you're crazy.
No You are.
And I understand, but God, I I need you to believe me.
Please.
Please.
Listen I think you should go to the morgue tomorrow and see him for yourself.
It'll give you the answers that you need.
- But tonight - Oh, God.
I want you to try to get some sleep, if you can.
Byers' body was found in the water of this quarry by state police earlier this evening.
It was discovered by state trooper David O'Bannon, just after dark.
The state police are mounting an investigation to determine Byers' cause of death, but an initial inquiry Should I go down and talk to Michael? Give him time.
He'll come to us when he's ready.
Can you please stop that? Are you deaf? I thought we were friends, you know? But friends tell each other the truth.
And they definitely don't lie to each other.
You made me think Will was okay, that he was still out there, but he wasn't.
He wasn't! Maybe you thought you were helping, but you weren't.
You hurt me.
Do you understand? What you did sucks.
Lucas was right about you.
All along.
So come on and let me know Should I stay or should I go? Should I stay or should I go now? Should I stay or should I go now? If I go there will be trouble If I stay it will be double Will, is that you? It's Mike! Do you copy? Over.

What what time is it? It's almost 8:00.
We have to go.
Go where? Where? To see Will.
Michael? Hi, honey.
How are you feeling? I, uh I don't think I can go to school today.
Oh, that's fine, sweetie.
I need to drop off Nance, then I'm gonna check in on Barb's parents.
Why don't you grab a book or something and come with me? We can stop by the video store on the way back, pick out whatever you want.
Even R-rated.
I think I just want to stay home today.
I mean, if that's okay? Well, are you sure you're gonna be all right here by yourself? I think so.
Okay.
But if you need anything, call Dad at work.

No, not his funeral.
- Screw his funeral! - What? Just get over here stat.
And bring Dustin.
Over and out.
What's taking so long? Well, everything's been a bit chaotic around here without Gary.
Without Gary? - Where's Gary? - Well, I thought you knew.
Those men from State, they they sent Gary home last night.
So who did the autopsy? Someone from State.
He has a birth mark on his right arm.
Can you show that to me, please? How's your mom doing? I don't know.
How long's this stuff been going on? With the lights and, uh Will and the thing in the wall? Since the first phone call, I guess.
You know, she's had anxiety problems in the past.
But this I don't know.
I'm worried it could be Ugh, I don't know.
She'll be okay.
We'll be okay.
My mom she's tough.
Yeah, she is.
Hey.
She is.
Ma'am! - Ma'am, I need you to sign! - I don't I don't know what you think that thing is in there, but that is not my son! - Joyce, wait a second.
- No! - Mom! - Ma'am, I Ma'am! So, wait a sec.
I don't understand.
You went back to my house? To look for Barb.
Yeah, okay, but why didn't you just talk to me? That's crazy.
I don't know, I I was scared.
You seriously think you saw a guy in a mask just hanging out in my yard? I don't think it was a mask.
But he had no face? I don't know! I don't know, I just I have a terrible feeling about this.
Oh, this is bad.
This is really bad.
What? The cops they're gonna want to talk to all of us now.
Tommy, Carol, everybody who was at the party.
- So? - My parents are gonna murder me! Are you serious right now? You don't understand.
My dad's a grade-A asshole.
Barb is missing! And you're worried about your dad? Okay, just When you talk to the cops, just don't mention the beers.
It's just gonna get us both in trouble, and Barbara's got nothing to do with it, okay? I can't believe you right now.
- I can't believe you.
- Nancy.
Nancy, wait! Nancy! - Mom, will you get in? - No, I I need to think.
Just go on home.
Mom, will you just get in, please? Mom.
Mom! Mom.
- Stop.
- Just go home, Jonathan.
No, this is not an okay time for you to shut down.
- Shut down? What - We have to deal with this, Mom.
We have to deal with the funeral! The funeral? - For for who? - For that thing back there? Okay, let me get this straight.
Will, that's not his body, because he's in the lights, right? And there's a monster in the wall? Do you even hear yourself? I know it sounds crazy.
I sound crazy! - Yeah.
- You think I don't know that? It is crazy! But I heard him, Jonathan.
He talked to me! Will is is calling to me! And he's out there, and he's alone, and he's scared, and I I don't care if anyone believes me! I am not gonna stop looking for him until I find him and bring him home.
I am going to bring him home! Yeah, well, while you're talking to the lights, the rest of us are having a funeral for Will! I'm not letting him sit in that freezer another day! All right, show's over.
What? We keep losing the signal, but you heard it, right? Yeah, I heard a baby.
What? Mike, you obviously tapped into a baby monitor.
It's probably the Blackburns' next door.
Uh, did that sound like a baby to you? - That was Will! - Mike Lucas, you don't understand.
He spoke last night.
Words! He was singing that weird song he loves.
Even El heard him! Oh, well, if the weirdo heard him, then I guess Are you sure you're on the right channel? I don't think it's about that.
I think, somehow, she's channeling him.
- Like like Professor X.
- Yeah.
Are you actually believing this crap? I don't know, I mean Do you remember when Will fell off his bike and broke his finger? He sounded a lot like that.
Did you guys not see what I saw? They pulled Will's body out of the water.
He's dead! Well, maybe it's his ghost.
Maybe he's haunting us.
- It's not his ghost.
- So how do you know that? - I just do! - Then what was in that water? I don't know! All I know is Will is alive.
Will is alive! He's out there somewhere.
All we have to do is find him.
This isn't gonna work.
We need to get El to a stronger radio.
- Mr.
Clarke's Heathkit ham shack.
- Yeah.
The Heathkit's at school.
There is no way we're gonna get the weirdo in there without anyone noticing.
I mean look at her.
Wow.
- She looks - Pretty.
Good.
You look pretty good.
Pretty.
Good.
Clear.
- You boys hear me all right in there? - Loud and clear, Shepard.
Good luck in there, son.
"The brown current ran swiftly out of the heart of darkness, bearing us down towards the sea with twice the speed of our upward progress.
And Kurtz's life was running swiftly, too" Nancy Wheeler? If you'll come with me, please? This argument you and Barbara had? What exactly was it about? It wasn't really an argument.
Barb just wanted to leave.
I didn't, so, I I told her to just go home.
Then what? Then I went upstairs to put on some dry clothes.
And the next day, you went back and saw a bear, you're thinking? I don't know what it was, but I think I think maybe it took Barb.
- You need to check behind Steve's house - We did.
There's nothing there.
- There's no sign of a bear.
- And no car.
- What? - Look.
We figure that Barbara came back last night and then she took off, went somewhere else.
Has she ever talked to you about running off? Leaving town, maybe? No.
No, Barb wouldn't do that, ever.
She wasn't maybe upset about the fact that you were spending time with this boy? Uh, Steve Harrington? What? No! Maybe she was jealous because she saw you go up to Steve's room? It wasn't like that.
Like what? Steve and me, we're we're just friends.
We we just talked.
Now was this before or after you changed out of your clothes? So, Gary, tell me about these troopers that brought in Will.
It was about six of 'em, I'd say.
They're all Staties? Yes, sir.
Never seen that many troopers come with a body before.
They told you that they were gonna take care of the autopsy, huh? Yeah.
Claimed jurisdiction.
Kicked me out.
Well, it all seemed a bit over the top to me, considering Considering what? Considering this was Will Byers and not John F.
Kennedy.
- Thanks for stopping by, Gary.
- Sure thing.
let the people know that, uh, the troopers are on duty and you should be safe, because we think this is just an isolated incident.
State trooper David O'Bannon, thank you so much for your help.
- Thank you, sir.
- Back to you Okay, remember, if anyone sees us, look sad.
Attention students, there will be an assembly to honor Will Byers in the gymnasium now.
Do not go to fourth period.
It's locked.
- What? - Hey, do you think you can open it? With your powers? Boys? Hey.
Assembly's about to start.
We know.
We're just, you know Upset.
Yeah, definitely upset.
We need some alone time.
- To cry.
- Yeah, listen I get it.
I do.
I know how hard this is, but let's just be there for Will, huh? And then the Heathkit is all yours for the rest of the day.
What do you say? I don't believe we've met.
What's your name? - Eleven - Eleanor! She's my, uh - Cousin.
- Second cousin.
She's here for Will's funeral.
Ah, well, welcome to Hawkins Middle, Eleanor.
I wish you were here under better circumstances.
Thank you.
Uh, where are you from exactly? Bad place - Sweden! - I have a lot of Swedish family.
- She hates it there.
- Cold! Subzero.
- Shall we? - Yep! At times like these it is important that we come together as a community.
We come Abort.
We come together to heal we come together to grieve - You lied to the police! - I didn't lie! How naive do you think I am? You and Steve were just talking? We slept together! Is that what you want to know? It doesn't matter! - It does matter! - No! It is all bullshit! It has nothing to do with Barb and she's missing.
And something terrible happened to her.
I know it.
I know it! And no one is listening to me! Sweetie, sweetie, I'm listening.
- I'm listening to you - No! You're not! Nancy Nancy! Just leave me alone! Try him again.
Shepard, come in.

Shepard, come in! Over.
Will Byers' death is an unimaginable tragedy.
Will was an exceptional student and a wonderful friend to all of us.
It's impossible to express the hole his loss will leave in our community.
I'd like to introduce you to Sandy Sloane.
She's a local grief counselor from the church over in Jonesboro.
But before she comes up here, I just want those of you who are having trouble dealing with this tragic loss Look at these fakers.
They probably didn't even know his name till today.
What? Who is interested in this? This is so stupid.
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah Oh, he was such a great student.
Oh, he's going to leave a hole in the community.
Mouth breather.
Hey! Hey! Hey, Troy! Hey, Troy! You you think this is funny? What'd you say, Wheeler? I saw you guys laughing over there.
And I think that's a real messed up thing to do.
Didn't you listen to the counselor, Wheeler? Grief shows itself in funny ways.
Besides, what's there to be sad about, anyway? Will's in fairyland now, right? Flying around with all the other little fairies.
All happy and gay! You're dead, Wheeler! Dead! Dude, Troy peed himself.
Holy shit! Hey! What's going on here? Oh.
Mike! Let's go! It's made of soft wood with a crepe interior.
Uh, now, I I don't know what your budget is, but over here, we we have copper and bronze.
Can you just give me a second? Of course.
Hey.
Hey.
Your mom, um she said you'd be here.
I just Can we talk for a second? It looks like it could be some kind of perspective distortion, but I wasn't using the wide angle.
I don't know.
It's weird.
And you're sure you didn't see anyone else out there? No.
And she was there one second and then, um gone.
I figured she bolted.
The cops think that she ran away.
But they don't know Barb.
And I went back to Steve's and I thought I saw something.
Some weird man or I don't know what it was.
I'm sorry.
I I shouldn't have come here today.
I'm I'm so sorry.
What'd he look like? What? This man you saw in the woods.
What'd he look like? I don't know.
It was almost like he he didn't have Didn't have a face? How did you know that? Aw, come on! Another, please.
And another for my, uh, friend here.
Oh, thanks, man.
Appreciate it.
Yeah, that's all right.
I'm, uh I'm celebrating.
My daughter, she won the spelling bee today.
Is that right? Yeah, that's right.
"Odontalgia.
" That was the word.
You know what it means? It's a fancy name for a toothache.
Yeah, she's smart.
She's real smart.
Don't know where she gets it from.
I've been tryin' to figure that out for years.
Your daughter, she got a name? What? Your daughter? What's her name? Sarah.
Her name's Sarah.
To Sarah.
I recognize you.
Are you famous or somethin'? Uh, you might have seen me on TV, I, uh I found that Byers boy.
So, you on that case or what? I just saw him on patrol, you know? Dumb luck.
So that quarry, that's, uh that's state-run, where they found the boy, huh? Yeah.
Yeah, well, that's funny.
'Cause, you know, I know for a fact that it's run by the Sattler Company.
Frank Sattler? Decent guy, still got a couple operational quarries up in Roane.
- Is that right? - Yeah.
That's right.
So why are you lying to me, man? What's your problem, bud? I don't have a problem.
I'm just a concerned citizen.
